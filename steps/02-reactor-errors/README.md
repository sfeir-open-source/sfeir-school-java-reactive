# School Spring Reactor - Workshop 2

**Goal** : Use operators for errors and recovery, handle case of backpressure

import : _`/steps/02-reactor-errors`_

- test classes :
  - _`Workshop02ErrorsTest`_
  - _`Workshop02BackPressureTest`_

- You must fill missing code in method from classes, to pass unit tests :
  - _`Workshop02Errors`_
  - _`Workshop02BackPressure`_


### Bonus
In addition, some tests are more advanced cases annotated with `@Disabled`.
Feel free to remove the `@Disabled` annotation on those to try those exercises too.

I you have enough time, you can still try to complete `@Disabled` tests from previous workshop.
